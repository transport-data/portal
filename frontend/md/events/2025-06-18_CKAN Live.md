The Transport Data Commons Initiative was recently featured in CKAN Live, a community event hosted by Datopian that brings together CKAN practitioners from around the world. The session highlighted the vision behind the TDCIâ€™s and its contributions to the open data ecosystem in the transport sector. The event included a first preview of the TDC Portal to the general public. A recording of the event is available to watch on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6twYgX7zo).
