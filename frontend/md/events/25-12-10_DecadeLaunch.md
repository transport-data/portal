To kickstart the United Nations Decade of Sustainable Transport with tangible action, United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs has opened a call for Sustainable Transport Action Commitments. These commitments and initiatives can be made by all Member States and other stakeholders, and they aim at delivering concrete progress throughout the UN Decade. 

The TDCI has submitted a Voluntary Committment to support the UN Decade of Sustainable Transport as a means of tracking the transformation, and will be presented as part of the Decade Launch in New York on 10th December 2025.
