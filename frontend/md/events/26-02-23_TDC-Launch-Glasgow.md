The TDC Global Launch in Glasgow will focus on demonstrating the value of the TDC to data providers, users and funders. During a two-day workshop, participants from partner institutions will co-create a future for the Commons as a foundation for NDC implementation, progress tracking, and climate finance access during the UN Decade of Sustainable Transport (2026-2035).
The programme centres on diverse global perspectives on transport data gaps, the practical barriers faced by data providers, data users and would-be funders, and what is needed to unlock data to i) track progress in the transport sector and ii) allow the development of pathways to support low-carbon, socially just transport futures that can contibute positively to economic development.
