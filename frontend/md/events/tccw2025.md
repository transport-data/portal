The TDCI is inviting interested stakeholders to the side-event “Towards a Transport Data Commons Initiative – Making High Quality Transport Data Accessible” on 25th September, 2025, at the Transport and Climate Change Week in Berlin.

The session will provide a platform to update participants on recent activities of the Transport Data Commons and to discuss opportunities for engagement. In particular, we will explore practical approaches to opening and sharing transport data, with a focus on collaboration across international organizations, governments, and development partners.
