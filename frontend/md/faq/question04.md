title: 4) How to submit data?
---

To submit data on the TDC Portal, you must first register an account. Refer to **Step 2** for guidance.

Data is published through organisations on the TDC Portal. You must be a member of an organisation to contribute data. You can either join an existing organisation or request the creation of a new one. For detailed instructions, see **Step 3**.

Only users with editor or admin roles have permission to submit and publish data through an organisation. For more details, refer to the **Organisation** section below.

Once the above requirements are met, you can publish data. After logging in, the "**Add Data**" option will appear on your Dashboard. This option guides you through the data submission form, where you can provide necessary details and metadata for your dataset. You can save your dataset as a draft before submitting it. Drafts are accessible under the "**My Datasets**" section of your Dashboard for further editing or submission.

By default, all datasets are submitted as **private** on the TDC platform. Private datasets do not require admin approval and are only visible to members of the organisation. For information on the distinction between private and public datasets, see the relevant section below.

If you select "**Publish Data**" in the form, your dataset will be sent to an admin for approval. You will be notified once your data is approved or rejected.

If you experience any issues during the submission process, [please contact the TDC team](https://portal.transport-data.org/contact).
