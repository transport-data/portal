title: How does the TDC define sensitive data?
category: licenses
---

The TDC Portal is designed to publish data that can be __openly shared within the transport community__. However, some data may be considered sensitive and therefore not suitable for publication on the Portal. Sensitive data generally includes:

- Personal or confidential information (e.g., names, contact details, individual travel patterns)

- Proprietary or commercial data where the owner has not granted permission for sharing

- Security-related information that could pose risks if disclosed (e.g., detailed transport infrastructure vulnerabilities)

As a rule of thumb: If data cannot be shared publicly without restrictions, it should not be uploaded to the TDC Portal.

When in doubt, [please contact the TDC support team before publishing](https://tdc-data-portal.vercel.app/faq#issues).
