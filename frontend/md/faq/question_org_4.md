category: organizations

Organisations on the TDC Portal are created and managed by the TDC Administration team to ensure consistent naming, structure, and data governance.

If your organisation is not yet listed and you would like to publish datasets under its name, you may request the creation of an organisation via the TDC Portal ([Dashboard](https://portal.transport-data.org/dashboard) > Join Organisation > Request a new organisation), or contact the TDC support team directly with the following information:

- Full name of the organisation
- Short description (2â€“3 sentences)
- Logo (optional, preferred format: .png, .svg)
- Organisational Email

Once approved, the organisation will be created, and you (or a nominated admin) will be linked as the initial administrator.
