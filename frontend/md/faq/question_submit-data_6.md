title: How does the data preview work on the TDC Portal?
category: submitting_data

For datasets uploaded in **CSV** or **Excel** format, the TDC Portal automatically generates a **data preview** that allows you to quickly explore the table directly in your browser, without downloading the file.

You can easily **enable** or **disable** the preview by clicking on the **eye symbol** next to the file in the upload section of the submission form.

This feature makes it easier to check the structure and content of the dataset before deciding to download the full file.
