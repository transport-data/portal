To share data on the TDC platform, you must create an organisation. This can be done during the Sign-Up process or from the [Organisations](https://tdc-data-portal.vercel.app/dashboard/organizations) tab in your profile dashboard. Click the [Join an Organisation](https://tdc-data-portal.vercel.app/dashboard/organizations) button to request joining an existing organisation or to submit a request for a new one.
This information will be reviewed, and we may request additional details.
