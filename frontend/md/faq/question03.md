To share data on the TDC platform, your user must be linked to an organisation. This can be done during the Sign-Up process or from the [Organisations](https://tdc-data-portal.vercel.app/dashboard/organizations) tab in your profile dashboard. Click the [Join an Organisation](https://tdc-data-portal.vercel.app/dashboard/organizations) button to request joining an existing organisation or to submit a request for a new organisation, if your affiliation is now reflected among the existing organisations on the Portal.

This information will be reviewed by the organisation's administrator, and we may request additional details.
