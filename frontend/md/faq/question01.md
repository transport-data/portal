title: 1) How to search data on the platform?
---

The TDC Portal provides multiple ways to query data. 

Use the search bar on the [__Homepage__](https://portal.transport-data.org/) or on the [__Datasets__](https://portal.transport-data.org/datasets) to enter keywords like topic, location, or year. Use the search facets ('region', 'country', 'after', 'before' and 'sector') to narrow down your search. Advanced filters are also available to refine results by organisations, formats, or keywords. Use the [__Geography__](https://portal.transport-data.org/geography) page to search for country-specific data.

Go the the __Search__ section or watch the [video tutorial](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d5d5c2b0-b761-4435-8c09-252fcba21529) for further instructions.
