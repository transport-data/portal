category: search

You can share content from the TDC Portal in several ways:

- __Datasets__: Each dataset has its own unique URL (found in your browser’s address bar). Copy and share this link to allow others to access the dataset directly.

- __Resources__: On a dataset page, you can also share a specific file, API endpoint, or visualization by copying the corresponding link.

- __Search results__: If you’d like to share the outcome of a search query (e.g. vehicle sales
), simply copy the full URL from your browser after running the search. This will reproduce the same filtered results for others.

Please remember that all data is subject to the license indicated on the dataset page. __Always check licensing terms before redistributing or reusing data__.
