title: How to submit data via the TDC Portal?
category: submitting_data
---

The TDC Portal offers two options to submit data to the Transport Data Commons. The __submission form__ on the TDC Portal is designed to make it easy to submit your data and metadata. Advanced users may prefer to use the second option, to submit data via the TDC Portal API. See the [Resources for Developers](https://portal.transport-data.org/faq#devs) section for further information on the latter option.

After logging in, the __"Add Data"__ option will appear on your [Dashboard](https://portal.transport-data.org/dashboard). This option guides you through the data submission form, where you can provide necessary details and metadata for your dataset. You can save your dataset as a draft before submitting it. Drafts are accessible under the __"My Datasets"__ section of your Dashboard for further editing or submission.

By default, all datasets are submitted as private on the TDC platform. Private datasets do not require admin approval and are only visible to members of the organisation. For information on the distinction between private and public datasets, see the relevant section below.

If you select __"Publish Data"__ in the form, your dataset will be sent to an admin for approval. You will be notified once your data is approved or rejected.

If you experience any issues during the submission process, [please contact the TDC team](https://portal.transport-data.org/faq#issues).

Further guidance on the usage of the TDC Portal for data submission can be found [here](https://docs.transport-data.org/en/latest/howto/portal.html) or in the [video tutorial](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af8f70bd-b68d-4a25-bede-40c8739d22a6)
