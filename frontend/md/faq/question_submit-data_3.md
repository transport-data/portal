Datasets submitted by users must be approved by an **Admin** before they can be published on the TDC Portal. If you hold the admin role for your organisation, you will receive an email notification whenever a user submits data through your organisation. The dataset will appear in the **Dataset Approval** section of your Dashboard for review.

If a dataset does not meet the necessary requirements for approval, you can provide feedback to the user by including a message with the rejection notification.

For further information on the role-based user management system, please visit the [Organisations](https://portal.transport-data.org/faq#organizations) section of this FAQ site or visit the [official CKAN documentation](https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.11/user-guide.html#managing-an-organization). 

Watch the [video tutorial](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4887995-16e2-44ad-993b-0511569abbab) for further guidance on the approval process.
