The TDC Portal offers two options to submit data to the Transport Data Commons. The submission form is designed to make it easy to submit your data and metadata. Advanced users may prefer to use the second option, to submit data via the TDC Portal API.

For further guidance on the usage of the TDC Portal for data submission can be found [here](https://docs.transport-data.org/en/latest/howto/portal.html).
