category: licenses

The TDC Portal promotes the use of licenses developed by the [Creative Commons Foundation](http://creativecommons.org/) and the [Open Data Foundation](http://opendatacommons.org/). The main difference between the two classes of licenses is that the Creative Commons licenses were developed for sharing creative works in general, while the Open Data Commons licenses were developed more specifically for sharing databases. The full list of licenses is provided on the data submission form.
