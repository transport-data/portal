title: Which options do I have to search data on the TDC Portal?
category: search
---

The TDC Portal provides multiple ways to query data. 

- Use the search bar on the [Homepage](https://portal.transport-data.org/) or on the [Datasets](https://portal.transport-data.org/datasets) to enter keywords like topic, location, or year. Use the search facets ('region', 'country', 'after', 'before' and 'sector') to narrow down your search. 
- When using the [Search](https://portal.transport-data.org/search) page, advanced filters are available to refine results by organisations, formats, or keywords.
- Use the [Geography](https://portal.transport-data.org/geography) page to search for country-specific data.
