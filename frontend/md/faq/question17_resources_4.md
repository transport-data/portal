To publish data to the TDC Portal via the API, you need an API key to authenticate your requests. The API key acts like a password and ensures that only authorized users can upload or modify data.

#### Get your API key:

1. Log in to the TDC Portal.

2. Click on your username in the top-right corner and select "Settings".

3. By selecting "New Token" you can provide a name to the token that will serve as your new API key.

4. After selecting "Create Token", your API key will be displayed on your settings page.

__Important:__ Make sure to copy and save it now, as you won't be able to see it again. Keep this key secure and do not share it publicly. You can always create a new token, in case you lost your previous key.

#### Use your API key in requests:
Include your API key in the HTTP header when making API calls. Hereâ€™s an example using curl to create a new dataset, using the [package_create](https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.9/api/#ckan.logic.action.create.package_create) command:

~~~bash
curl -X POST https://ckan.tdc.prod.datopian.com/api/3/action/package_create \
  -H "Authorization: <YOUR-API-KEY>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "name": "example-dataset",
        "title": "Example Dataset",
        "description": "This is a sample dataset created via the API."
      }'
~~~

You can also use Python (with the requests library), Postman, or other tools to send similar requests. See the following documentation for example scripts for the [creation of packages](https://github.com/transport-data/portal/blob/main/src/ckanext-tdc/ckanext/tdc/data-integration/README.md#package-create) and [resources](https://github.com/transport-data/portal/blob/main/src/ckanext-tdc/ckanext/tdc/data-integration/README.md#resource-create) with Python.
