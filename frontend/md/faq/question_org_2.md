During the user sign-up process, you will be asked for your affiliation and given the option to choose from the organisations already present on the TDC Portal. This step is optional but recommended, as you will only be able to submit data by linking your user account to an organisation.

In case you skipped this step during sign-up, you are able to join an organisation by visiting your [Dashboard](https://portal.transport-data.org/dashboard) and selecting the __"Join Organisation"__ button. If you are already part of one, this option also allows you to request membership in another.
