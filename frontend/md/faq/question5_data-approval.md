Datasets submitted by users must be approved by an **admin** before they can be published on the TDC Portal. If you hold the admin role for your organisation, you will receive an email notification whenever a user submits data through your organisation. The dataset will appear in the **Dataset Approval** section of your Dashboard for review.

If a dataset does not meet the necessary requirements for approval, you can provide feedback to the user by including a message with the rejection notification.
