An organisation is an entity that publishes data on the TDC Portal. Organisations are a central concept for the management of datasets on a CKAN platform, as they define which users are allowed to see, publish and edit individual datasets. 

In order to submit data on the TDC Portal, your user must be linked to at least one organisation on the Portal, with at least _Editor_ rights. See below for further information on how to join or create organisations.
