The **Public Domain Dedication and License (PDDL)** is the Open Data Commons equivalent of CC0, designed specifically for databases.

**Key features:**
- Places the database in the **public domain**
- **No copyright** is asserted over the database
- **No restrictions** on use, modification, or distribution
- **No attribution required** (though appreciated)

**What this means:**
- Anyone can freely use, modify, and share the database
- No permission needed for any purpose
- Commercial use is allowed
- Derivatives don't need to maintain the same license

**Best for:** 
- Organizations wanting maximum data dissemination
- Government or publicly funded databases
- Data where you want zero restrictions on reuse

**Difference from ODbL:**
- PDDL has **no attribution requirement**
- PDDL has **no share-alike requirement**
- Maximum freedom for users
