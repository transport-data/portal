Understanding data licenses is crucial for both data providers and users. The Transport Data Commons supports various open data licenses to ensure transparency and proper attribution while enabling data reuse.

All datasets on TDC must have a clearly defined license that specifies how the data can be used, shared, and attributed. Visit the [Creative Commons chooser](https://creativecommons.org/chooser/) for further guidance.

Note: If you would like us to include other license options for data shared through HDX, please send us an email with your request at [contact@transport-data.org](mailto:contact@transport-data.org).
