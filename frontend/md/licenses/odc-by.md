The **Open Data Commons Attribution License (ODC-By)** allows users to freely share, modify, and use a database, with only an attribution requirement.

**You are free to:**
- **Share** — Copy and redistribute the database
- **Create** — Produce works from the database  
- **Adapt** — Modify, transform, and build upon the database
- **Commercial use** — Use for commercial purposes

**Under the following condition:**
- **Attribution** — You must attribute the original database and its creator(s)

**What makes ODC-By different:**
- **No share-alike requirement** — Derivatives can be distributed under different licenses
- **More permissive than ODbL** — Only attribution is required
- **Similar to CC BY** — But specifically designed for databases

**Best for:**
- Databases where you want attribution but maximum flexibility for reuse
- Data that you want widely adopted without license restrictions on derivatives
- Situations where share-alike requirements might limit adoption

**Attribution requirements:**
- Name the database and its creator(s)
- Provide a link to the license
- Indicate if changes were made
- Don't suggest the licensor endorses your use
