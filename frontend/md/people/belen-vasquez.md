I am a Junior Advisor in Transport and Climate Change and an advocate for active mobility. I believe that when transport systems are thoughtfully designed, they can enhance quality of life and drive sustainable change. I am particularly interested in how data and emerging technologies can maximise impact.
Having lived in Latin America, Europe, and Asia, I value international collaboration and have a deep appreciation for diverse local contexts.
