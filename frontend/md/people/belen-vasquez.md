I am currently heading GIZ's global projects on transport and climate change TraCS and TRANSfer - both funded by the German Ministry for the Environment. From 2011 to 2015, I have lived in Beijing and headed various sustainable transport projects in China. Interested in a broad range of topics (e.g. urban mobility, freight and logistics, green hydrogen (PtX), electromobility), my passion is to understand and reduce transport emissions. Before joining GIZ in 2009, I researched sustainable mobility at the German think tank Wuppertal Institute for Climate, Environment and Energy.
