I am a Junior Specialist for Transport Data and Digitalization at the German Development Cooperation (GIZ). With a background in Europe and Latin America, I am passionate about integrated data-driven approaches to fight climate change on a global scale. I hold a master's degree in Industrial Engineering at Karlsruhe Institute for Technology, where I particularly focused on the topics of simulation, machine learning and mobility data. Previously, I worked for KITâ€™s chair for Economic Policy as well as for the Data Science team of Mercedes-Benz Tech Innovation.
