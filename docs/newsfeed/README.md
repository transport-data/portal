# Newsfeed Page

The newsfeed page shows the activity regarding organizations that a user is a member of, or follower and also the datasets that belong to these organizations

User can search by activity type/name, Dataset name and title, Organization name and title, and actor.

User can filter activities based on four categories:

- All
- Organizations
- Datasets
- Dataset Approvals

`Note:` For now Datasets and Dataset Approvals are doing the exact same thing (filtering on Datasets) because the Dataset Approval flow is not implemented yet. //TODO remove this in future.

User can sort by latest and oldest activities.
