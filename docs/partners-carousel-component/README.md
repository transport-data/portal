# Partners Carousel Component

### Managing the Partners Images

To manage the images presented on the carousel you need to add an image on the [partners folder](../../frontend/public/images/logos/partners) then add the name of the file on the list of the images presented on the carousel [here](https://github.com/transport-data/portal/blob/main/frontend/src/components/_shared/PartnersCarousel.tsx#L36).
