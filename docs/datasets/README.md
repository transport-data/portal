## Create Dataset

You can create a dataset in the `/dashboard/datasets/create` route or by clicking in `Add Data` in the dashboard 

![Go to create page](./go_to_create.png)

Here you can add all the fields specified in the matadata schema, such as

- Title for the dataset
- URL for the dataset, which is going to act as an ID for the dataset, and act as URL in the public pages such `/datasets/{dataset url}`
- Description for the dataset
- You can also upload the resources and documentation for the datasets in the last step
- And many others

The page looks like this

To view the Datasets list, you can go to `/search`.

The search function allows you to search for datasets using multiple criteria, including the dataset name, title, regions, countries (geographies), resource formats, publication dates, organizations, keywords (tags), and whether the dataset is archived. The results can be sorted by relevance, last modified date, and name, either descending or ascending.
